=====================================
Using ``jcmd`` with CrateDB on Docker
=====================================

Most the guides about Java diagnostic utilities explain how to use them on
applications running directly as process on the operating system. Fewer of
them cover how to apply ``jcmd`` commands inside a Docker container.

.. rubric:: Introduction

When it comes to troubleshooting a CrateDB instance running inside a container
like Docker, things work a bit differently.
This document explains why the standard way to run ``jcmd`` does not work, and
how to solve it.

.. note::

    The document does not explain how to analyze the output, because that is
    identical to non-containerized applications.

Run ``jcmd`` inside container
=============================

The commands below use ``docker``. In the same spirit, you can also use
``podman``.

.. rubric:: Connect with user ``crate``

When aiming to invoke ``jcmd`` inside the container, please make sure to
impersonate as the ``crate`` user.

.. code-block:: console

    docker exec -it --user=crate cratedb /bin/bash
    /crate/jdk/bin/jcmd 1 VM.version

Otherwise, the command will fail with an error like ``AttachNotSupportedException:
Unable to open socket file /proc/1/root/tmp/.java_pid1``.


.. rubric:: Root Cause

The entrypoint_ of the ``crate`` Docker image ensures that the CrateDB Java
process runs as user ``crate``, since **CrateDB must be run as a non-root
user**.

This is done by ``chroot`` ing with user ``crate`` (``chroot --userspec=1000 /
"$@"``), because this does not spawn an additional process for changing the
user - unlike ``su crate -c "$@"``, where ``su`` would result in the process
with PID ``1`` and the crate command would be a child-process with a different
PID. This is not what one wants in a Docker container, where the application
must (?) run as PID 1.


.. rubric:: Examples

Let's start by starting a ``cratedb`` container.

.. code-block:: console

    docker run --rm -it --name=cratedb \
        --publish=4200:4200 --publish=5432:5432 \
        --env=CRATE_HEAP_SIZE=2g crate/crate:nightly \
        -Cdiscovery.type=single-node

.. code-block:: console

    docker exec -it --user=crate cratedb /bin/bash
    $ /crate/jdk/bin/jcmd -l
    1 io.crate.bootstrap.CrateDB -Cpath.home=/crate -Cdiscovery.type=single-node
    301 jdk.jcmd/sun.tools.jcmd.JCmd -l

.. code-block:: console

   [crate@cratedb data]# /crate/jdk/bin/jcmd 1 VM.version
   1:
   OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM version 13.0.1+9
   JDK 13.0.1

``jcmd <PID> help`` lists all available commands that you can now start using
for troubleshooting CrateDB inside the Docker container.

.. code-block:: console

   [crate@cratedb data]# /crate/jdk/bin/jcmd 1 help
   1:
   The following commands are available:
   Compiler.CodeHeap_Analytics
   Compiler.codecache
   Compiler.codelist
   Compiler.directives_add
   Compiler.directives_clear
   Compiler.directives_print
   Compiler.directives_remove
   Compiler.queue
   GC.class_histogram
   GC.class_stats
   GC.finalizer_info
   GC.heap_dump
   GC.heap_info
   GC.run
   GC.run_finalization
   JFR.check
   JFR.configure
   JFR.dump
   JFR.start
   JFR.stop
   JVMTI.agent_load
   JVMTI.data_dump
   ManagementAgent.start
   ManagementAgent.start_local
   ManagementAgent.status
   ManagementAgent.stop
   Thread.print
   VM.class_hierarchy
   VM.classloader_stats
   VM.classloaders
   VM.command_line

   VM.events
   VM.flags
   VM.info
   VM.log
   VM.metaspace
   VM.native_memory
   VM.print_touched_methods
   VM.set_flag
   VM.stringtable
   VM.symboltable
   VM.system_properties
   VM.systemdictionary
   VM.uptime
   VM.version
   help

   For more information about a specific command use 'help <command>'.

To execute one of these commands from outside of the Docker container without
explicitly attaching to it, you can combine the ``docker exec`` command with the
``jcmd`` command.

.. code-block:: console

   $ docker exec -it --user=crate cratedb /crate/jdk/bin/jcmd 1 <CMD>

For example, running ``GC.heap_info`` on Docker container with ID
``cratedb``.

.. code-block:: console

   $ docker exec -it --user=crate cratedb /crate/jdk/bin/jcmd 1 GC.heap_info
   1:
    garbage-first heap   total 524288K, used 129716K [0x00000000e0000000, 0x0000000100000000)
     region size 1024K, 126 young (129024K), 22 survivors (22528K)
    Metaspace       used 57165K, capacity 59755K, committed 60080K, reserved 1099776K
     class space    used 7721K, capacity 8941K, committed 8960K, reserved 1048576K


Troubleshooting Commands
========================

These are the most common troubleshooting tasks, but of course there are many
more possibilities to get diagnostic information using the ``jcmd`` command.
You can find more information about the utility at the `jcmd documentation`_.

Heap Info
---------

:Command: ``jcmd <PID> GC.heap_info``

.. rubric:: Example

.. code-block:: console

   $ docker exec -it --user=crate cratedb /crate/jdk/bin/jcmd 1 GC.heap_info
   1:
   ...


Heap Dump
---------

:Command: ``jcmd <PID> GC.heap_dump <PATH>``

.. rubric:: Example

.. code-block:: console

   $ docker exec -it --user=crate cratedb /crate/jdk/bin/jcmd 1 GC.heap_dump /data/crate.hprof
   1:
   Heap dump file created

.. note::

   The ``<PATH>`` should be a path that resides on a mounted volume, so you can
   access the created heap dump from ouside of the container and the container
   is not "blown up".


Thread Dump
-----------

:Command: ``jcmd <PID> Thread.print``

.. rubric:: Example

.. code-block:: console

   $ docker exec -it --user=crate cratedb /crate/jdk/bin/jcmd 1 Thread.print
   1:
   ...


.. _jfr-docker:

Java Flight Recorder (JFR)
--------------------------

:Command: ``jcmd <PID> JFR.start name=<NAME> duration=<DURATION> filename=<PATH> settings=profile``

.. rubric:: Example

.. code-block:: console

   $ docker exec -it --user=crate cratedb /crate/jdk/bin/jcmd 1 JFR.start name=recording1 duration=60s filename=/data/recording1.jfr
   1:
   Started recording 1. The result will be written to:

   /data/recording1.jfr

.. note::

   The ``<PATH>`` should be a path that resides on a mounted volume, so you can
   access the created jfr dump from ouside of the container and the container
   is not "blown up".


Notes
=====

Previously, you needed to use a ``chroot`` command inside the container, in
order to invoke the ``jcmd`` command properly. While this procedure still works,
it is more convenient to use the ``--user`` option as outlined above.

In case you need the old variant, we are displaying it below.

.. code-block:: console

   [user@host ~]# docker exec -it cratedb /bin/bash
   [crate@cratedb data]# chroot --userspec=1000 / /crate/jdk/bin/jcmd 1 VM.version
   1:
   OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM version 13.0.1+9
   JDK 13.0.1

.. code-block:: console

    docker exec -it cratedb chroot --userspec=1000 / /bin/bash
    /crate/jdk/bin/jcmd 1 VM.version
