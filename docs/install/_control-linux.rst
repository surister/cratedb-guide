Control CrateDB on Linux
========================

You can control the ``crate`` service with the ``systemctl`` utility program::

    sudo systemctl COMMAND crate

Replace ``COMMAND`` with ``start``, ``stop``, ``restart``, ``status`` and
so on.

Notes
=====

After the installation is finished, the ``crate`` service should be installed,
but may not be configured to start automatically. Use the following command to
start CrateDB::

    sudo systemctl start crate

In order to make the service reboot-safe, invoke::

    sudo systemctl enable crate
