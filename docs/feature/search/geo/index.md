**CrateDB supports location data for efficiently storing and querying
geographic and spatial/geospatial data.**

:::{rubric} Overview
:::
CrateDB can be used as a database to conduct geospatial search operations
building upon the Prefix Tree and BKD-tree index structures of Apache Lucene.

:::{rubric} About
:::
Using spatial search, you can:
- Index points or other shapes.
- Filter search results by a bounding box, circle, donut, or other shape.
- Sort or boost scoring by distance between points, or relative area between rectangles.

:::{rubric} Details
:::
CrateDB's GEO_POINT and GEO_SHAPE geographic data types represent points
or shapes in a 2D world.

:GEO_POINT:
    A geographic data type used to store latitude and longitude coordinates.
:GEO_SHAPE:
    A geographic data type used to store 2D shapes defined as GeoJSON geometry
    objects. It supports Point, MultiPoint, LineString, MultiLineString,
    Polygon, MultiPolygon, and GeometryCollection.

When inserting spatial data, you can use [GeoJSON] or [WKT] formats.

- Geographic points can be inserted as a double precision array with longitude and
  latitude values, or by using a WKT string.
- Geographic shapes can be inserted as GeoJSON object literal or parameter as seen
  above and as WKT string.

:::{rubric} About Lucene
:::
CrateDB uses Lucene as a storage layer, so it inherits the implementation
and concepts of Lucene, in the same spirit like Solr and Elasticsearch.

- [Geospatial Indexing with Apache Lucene and OpenSearch]
- [Apache Solr Spatial Search]

:::{div}
While Elasticsearch uses a [query DSL based on JSON], in CrateDB, you can work
with geospatial data using SQL.
:::


## Synopsis

Select data points by distance.

```sql
/**
 * Based on the location of the International Space Station,
 * this query returns the 10 closest capital cities from
 * the last known position.
**/

SELECT
  city AS "City Name",
  country AS "Country",
  DISTANCE(i.position, c.location)::LONG / 1000
    AS "Distance [km]"
FROM demo.iss i
CROSS JOIN demo.world_cities c
WHERE capital = 'primary'
  AND ts = (SELECT MAX(ts) FROM demo.iss)
ORDER BY 3 ASC
LIMIT 10;
```


## Usage

Using geographic search in CrateDB.

:::{rubric} Index Structure Type
:::
Computations on very complex polygons and geometry collections are exact but
very expensive. To provide fast queries even on complex shapes, CrateDB uses
a different approach to store, analyze and query geo shapes. The available
geo shape indexing strategies are based on two primary data structures: Prefix
and BKD trees, which are described below.

There are three geographic index types: `geohash` (default), `quadtree`, and
`bkdtree`, described in more detail at [](inv:crate-reference#type-geo_shape-index).

:::{rubric} Column Definition
:::
Learn how to define a `GEO_SHAPE` column, and how to adjust parameters of the
index structure in the documentation section about
[](inv:crate-reference#type-geo_shape-definition).

:::{rubric} `MATCH` predicate
:::
CrateDB's [MATCH predicate for geographical search] can be used to query
geographic indices for relations between geographical shapes and points.
It supports the **intersects**, **disjoint**, and **within** operations.

**Let's Go Plane Spotting with Software Defined Radio, CrateDB and Node.js!**

Did you know that passing aircraft can be a rich source of real time data?
This talk will teach you how to receive and make sense of messages from
aircraft in real time using an ADS-B receiver / software defined radio.

You'll see how to decode the messages, store them in a CrateDB database,
and make sense of them. Finally, the talk demonstrates a system that alerts
you when specific types of aircraft are passing by so you can run outside
and see that 747 go past.

The hardware involved is a Raspberry Pi, a Radarbox flight stick, and a
flip dot sign. The software is written in JavaScript and runs on Node.js.
