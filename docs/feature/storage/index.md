The CrateDB storage layer is based on Lucene. By default, all fields are indexed,
nested or not, but the indexing can be turned off selectively.

This page enumerates some concepts of Lucene, and the article [Indexing and Storage in
CrateDB] goes into more details by exploring its internal workings.


## Lucene

Lucene offers scalable and high-performance indexing which enables efficient search and
aggregations over documents and rapid updates to the existing documents. Solr and
Elasticsearch are building upon the same technologies.

- **Documents**

  A single record in Lucene is called "document", which is a unit of information for search
  and indexing that contains a set of fields, where each field has a name and value. A Lucene
  index can store an arbitrary number of documents, with an arbitrary number of different fields.

- **Append-only segments**

  A Lucene index is composed of one or more sub-indexes. A sub-index is called a segment,
  it is immutable, and built from a set of documents. When new documents are added to the
  existing index, they are added to the next segment, while previous segments are never
  modified. If the number of segments becomes too large, the system may decide to merge
  some segments and discard the freed ones. This way, adding a new document does not require
  rebuilding the whole index structure completely.

- **Column store**

  For text values, other than storing the row data as-is (and indexing each value by default),
  each value term is stored into a [column-based store] by default, which offers performance
  improvements for global aggregations and groupings, and enables efficient ordering, because
  the data for one column is packed at one place.

  In CrateDB, the column store is enabled by default and can be disabled only for text fields,
  not for other primitive types. Furthermore, CrateDB does not support storing values for
  container and geospatial types in the column store.

## Data structures

This section enumerates the three main Lucene data structures that are used within
CrateDB: Inverted indexes for text values, BKD trees for numeric values, and DocValues.

- **Inverted index**

  The Lucene indexing strategy for text fields relies on a data structure called inverted
  index, which is defined as a "data structure storing a mapping from content, such as
  words and numbers, to its location in the database file, document or set of documents".

  Depending on the configuration of a column, the index can be plain (default) or full-text.
  An index of type "plain" indexes content of one or more fields without analyzing and
  tokenizing their values into terms. To create a "full-text" index, the field value is
  first analyzed and based on the used analyzer, split into smaller units, such as
  individual words. A full-text index is then created for each text unit separately.

  The inverted index enables a very efficient search over textual data.

- **BKD tree**

  To optimize numeric range queries, Lucene uses an implementation of the Block KD (BKD)
  tree data structure. The BKD tree index structure is suitable for indexing large
  multi-dimensional point data sets. It is an I/O-efficient dynamic data structure based
  on the KD tree. Contrary to its predecessors, the BKD tree maintains its high space
  utilization and excellent query and update performance regardless of the number of
  updates performed on it.

  Numeric range queries based on BKD trees can efficiently search numerical fields,
  including fields defined as `TIMESTAMP` types, supporting performant date range
  queries.

- **DocValues**

  Because Lucene's inverted index data structure implementation is not optimal for
  finding field values by given document identifier, and for performing column-oriented
  retrieval of data, the DocValues data structure is used for those purposes instead.

  DocValues is a column-based data storage built at document index time. They store
  all field values that are not analyzed as strings in a compact column, making it more
  effective for sorting and aggregations.
