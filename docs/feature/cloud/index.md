:::{rubric} Details
:::

CrateDB is an SQL database for enterprise data warehouse workloads,
that works across clouds and scales with your data.
It lets you run analytics over vast amounts of data in near real time,
even with complex queries.

You can run CrateDB anywhere. Whether you want complete peace of mind with the
DBaaS model, or deploy CrateDB yourself, we have the right option for you.

CrateDB is highly flexible and can be deployed on private or public cloud,
on-premises, edge, or in hybrid environments to meet your organization's
needs.

- {ref}`cloud:index` is a fully managed, terabyte-scale, and cost-effective analytics
  database offered as DBaaS.

- [CrateDB OSS] is the right option to deploy CrateDB yourself, to contribute
  features, and to explore and inspect its source code.
