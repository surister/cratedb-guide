:::{rubric} Machine Learning Operations
:::
Training a machine learning model, running it in production, and maintaining
it, requires a significant amount of data processing and bookkeeping
operations.

CrateDB, as a universal SQL database, supports this process through
adapters to best-of-breed software components for MLOps procedures.

[MLOps] is a paradigm that aims to deploy and maintain machine learning models
in production reliably and efficiently, including experiment tracking, and in
the spirit of continuous development and DevOps.

:::{rubric} Vector Store
:::
CrateDB's FLOAT_VECTOR data type implements a vector store and the k-nearest
neighbour (kNN) search algorithm to find vectors that are similar to a query
vector.

These feature vectors may be computed from raw data using machine learning
methods such as feature extraction algorithms, word embeddings, or deep
learning networks. 

[Vector databases][Vector Database] can be used for similarity search, multi-modal search,
recommendation engines, large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), and other applications.

**Blog: Running Time Series Models in Production using CrateDB**

Part 1: Introduction to [Time Series Modeling using Machine Learning]

The article will introduce you to the concept of time series modeling,
discussing the main obstacles running it in production.
It will introduce you to CrateDB, highlighting its key features and
benefits, why it stands out in managing time series data, and why it is
an especially good fit for supporting machine learning models in production.

## LLMs / RAG

One of the most powerful applications enabled by LLMs is sophisticated
question-answering (Q&A) chatbots.
These are applications that can answer questions about specific sources
of information, using a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation,
or RAG. RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional data.

### LlamaIndex

[LlamaIndex] is a data framework for Large Language Models (LLMs). It comes with
pre-trained models on massive public datasets such as GPT-4 or Llama 2, and
provides an interface to external data sources allowing for natural language
querying on your private data.

Azure Open AI Service is a fully managed service that runs on the Azure global
infrastructure and allows developers to integrate OpenAI models into their
applications. Through Azure Open AI API one can easily access a wide range of
AI models in a scalable and reliable way.

What can you do with LlamaIndex?

**Demo: Using LlamaIndex with OpenAI and CrateDB**

- Connect your CrateDB data to an LLM using OpenAI or Azure OpenAI.
- Query the database in human language,
  i.e. query CrateDB in plain English.
