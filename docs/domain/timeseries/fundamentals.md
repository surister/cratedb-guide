# Time Series Fundamentals with CrateDB

## Getting Started

After evaluating [connectivity options](#connect), you would like to get
hands-on with CrateDB. We prepared a few introductory tutorials, some of
them in executable forms, to demonstrate CrateDB's features to work with
time series data on the spot. You may want to use them as starting points
for your own explorations.

## Special Features
Working with time series data needs special feature support to enable
fluent data workflows.

## Operations
CrateDB provides operational support to store and query large time series data
efficiently.
